Create a web-based **Policy Debate Timer** for student debaters to keep track of speech and prep time. This app should have a clear, accessible layout optimized for mobile-first use, styled similarly to the screenshot I provided. Use **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript**. I am new to coding. generate the starter HTML + Tailwind + JavaScript code for this layout

### 🎨 **Style Guide (based on screenshot)**

* **Dark mode theme**: Use dark blue or black background throughout.
* **Rounded buttons**: Pill-shaped or medium-rounded edges.
* **Color-coded sections**:

  * **Affirmative speeches**: Blue buttons
  * **Negative/CX speeches**: Purple buttons
  * **Prep timer section**: Blue progress bar + blue buttons
  * **Action buttons**: Green for Start, Red for Reset
* **Modern UI**: Large, centered fonts; clean layout with lots of spacing and padding.
* **Consistent color themes**: Use Tailwind colors like `bg-blue-600`, `bg-purple-600`, `bg-red-600`, etc.

### 🧱 **Layout / Structure**

1. **Header**

   * `h1` centered: “Policy Debate Timer” in white, large font

2. **Speech Selection Panel**

   * Display a grid (2 rows) of **speech buttons**, each showing:

     * Speech name (e.g. “1AC”)
     * Speech time in parentheses (e.g. “(5m)”)
   * Buttons should trigger the timer below to set the selected speech duration and start the countdown.

3. **Main Speech Timer View**

   * Centered large digital clock (e.g. `5:00`)
   * Directly below the clock: A **draggable horizontal progress bar** (green) representing time remaining
   * Below that:

     * Green “Start” button
     * Red “Reset” button
   * When timer reaches 0:

     * Play a loud alarm sound
     * Flash timer background red briefly

4. **Prep Time Timer (below main timer)**

   * Subheading: “Prep Time (X\:XX remaining)”
   * Smaller digital clock for prep time (default 5:00)
   * Blue progress bar for prep time
   * Below bar:

     * Blue “Start Prep” button
     * Red “Reset Prep” button
   * Optional: Show toast-style popups for each minute of prep used (e.g. “You have used 1 minute of prep”)

5. 📋 Responsibilities Side Panel
   - Add a fixed “Responsibilities” button visible on the main interface.
   - When clicked:
	- A slide-in panel opens from the right.
	- Panel contains bullet-point responsibilities specific to the currently selected speech.
   - Requirements:
	- Speech Timer remains visible and on top even when the panel is open.
	- Panel should be non-intrusive, not covering or hiding any essential timer UI.
	- Use smooth animations for opening/closing the panel.
   - Allow responsibilities text to be updated easily via a JavaScript object or JSON file.
