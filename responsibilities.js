          In this speech, you get to kick off the debate! You go first, so it’s your job to introduce your plan and explain why it matters.
          You will show what problem needs fixing, how your plan solves it, and why that helps people.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Think of it like telling a story: you explain the problem, then show how your solution makes things better.

        <p class="font-semibold mb-2">✅ What you should do in the 1AC:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
          <li>Present a clear plan — tell the judge exactly what you want the government to do.</li>
          <li>Prove the stock issues — answer key questions that judges will look for (explained below!).</li>
          <li>Explain the advantages — why does your plan make the world better?</li>
          <li>Set up the debate — create a strong story for why the judge should believe you.</li>

          <li>Speak clearly and confidently — you are setting the tone for the round.</li>
          <li>Use clear tags or labels (example: “Our Plan is...”)</li>
          <li>Build a persuasive story so the judge wants to believe you.</li>
